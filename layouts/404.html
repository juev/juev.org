        It is the the duty of a Webmaster to allocate URIs which you will be able to
        stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200 years. This needs thought, and

I try my hardest to avoid this, so it may be that you have discovered a problem I don't know about yet. If you think
that is the case, you would do me a great service by contacting me at email address, and telling me about it.
